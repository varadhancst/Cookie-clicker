# Cookie-clicker
playing cookie clicker online game without user interaction using automation


I developed an automated script for the cookie clicker online game using Python. The script uses the Python Selenium library to control a web browser and interact with the game's user interface. The script is designed to play the game automatically by clicking on the cookie and purchasing upgrades as needed to maximize the player's cookie production. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement an automated script using Python and to apply web scraping and automation techniques.
